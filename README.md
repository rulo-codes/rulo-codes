**'Digital Creator (Developer/Designer/Creator)'**

Hi there 👋

I'm an full-stack developer working as a freelancer and a content creator as a hobby to make a digital impact. Building websites to solve real-world problems to make life easier or unnecessarely hard. I build functional websites and apps that is also intuitive and aesthetically pleassing UX/UI. I started creating content as a hobby, inspired by the YouTubers I grew up watching. As of now I am still a  newbie when it comes to both software development and content creation, but I am still excited and happy for finally finding something I really enjoy. To code and create.
